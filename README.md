# TradingATM
## Introduction
TradingATM is an innovative social copy trading platform designed to facilitate seamless copy trading across multiple trading platforms, including TradeLocker, MetaTrader 4 (MT4), and MetaTrader 5 (MT5). This Software as a Service (SaaS) platform allows users to register their trading accounts as "masters," enabling the tracking of their trading activities, which are then displayed in both chart and numerical formats. Other users can view the performance of all master accounts and choose to copy trades from profitable masters by registering their accounts as "copiers." The platform also provides tools for copiers to monitor their account performance effectively.
